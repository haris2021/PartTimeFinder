# About PartTimeFinder  

PartTimeFinder is a native iOS mobile application designed to help students find part-time jobs that align with their academic schedules. The app serves as a community platform where users can discover on-campus and off-campus roles and share job opportunities with others.

### How It Was Built  
PartTimeFinder was developed using the following technologies and tools:  
- **UIKit Framework**: For building a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.  
- **Swift**: For system-level iOS programming, ensuring smooth and responsive performance.  
- **Firebase Integration**: Leveraging Firebase for authentication, cloud storage, and managing a NoSQL Firestore database to handle user data securely.  
- **UIMapKit**: Calculates and displays the distance between the job location and the studentâ€™s current location on Apple Maps.  

This combination of cutting-edge tools and technologies helped create an app that is both functional and intuitive, aimed at making job searching more accessible for students everywhere.
